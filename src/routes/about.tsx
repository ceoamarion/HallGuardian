							Our Story
						</h2>
						<div className="space-y-6 text-gray-700">
							<p className="text-lg">
								HallGuardian began in 2024 when our founding team—former teachers, school
								administrators, and software engineers—came together with a shared frustration.
								Schools were spending tens of thousands of dollars on complex attendance systems
								that required dedicated hardware, extensive training, and often failed to deliver
								the real-time insights educators needed.
							</p>
							<p className="text-lg">
								We knew there had to be a better way. With smartphones already in students' hands
								or provided by schools, and QR codes being universally understood and easy to use,
								we set out to build a solution that would be both powerful and simple.
							</p>
							<p className="text-lg">
								Today, HallGuardian serves hundreds of schools across the country, helping track
								millions of student check-ins each month. But we're just getting started. We're
								committed to continually improving our platform, expanding our features, and
								supporting schools in their mission to provide the best possible education for
								every student.
